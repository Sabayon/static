[gio lug 23 2009] [15:30:06] <lxnay>	ping me back anytime
[gio lug 23 2009] [15:30:12] <lxnay>	and sorry for the delay
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:11:47] <Betelgeuse>	I have time next weekend at the earliest.
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:12:12] <lxnay>	ok no problem, i'll ping you on saturday
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:12:14] <lxnay>	ok?
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:12:29] <Betelgeuse>	that's fine
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:12:51] <lxnay>	i might be doing trekking, i don't know, but i'll drop you a query msg anyway
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:12:52] <Betelgeuse>	but try to actually do it
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:13:10] <Betelgeuse>	I don't have eternal patience
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:13:33] <lxnay>	we have until the 15th of august, i wouldn't worry that much ;)
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:13:52] <Betelgeuse>	well you are on overtime already any way
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:14:21] <lxnay>	we're all busy man, it's real life, it sucks
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:14:28] <lxnay>	yeah and I apologize
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:14:50] <Betelgeuse>	Sure but we like to recruit people who keep up their end.
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:14:55] <lxnay>	but i thought that someone was going to ping me after my last bug message
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:15:08] <lxnay>	anyway, it's fine
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:15:22] <lxnay>	we'll eventually do it, just a bit more patience
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:16:00] <Betelgeuse>	The point is that if we have problems scheduling and doing the interview it might indicate potential problems later down the line.
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:16:14] <Betelgeuse>	but let's see how it goes
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:16:38] <lxnay>	sure, just my apologies, i've been really busy to arrange stuff before summer vacation here
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:17:25] <Betelgeuse>	if you are too busy just let me know and we can postpone
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:17:25] <lxnay>	and family stuff...
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:17:53] <lxnay>	no, i'm free and ready anytime during the week, a bit less during weekends
[gio lug 23 2009] [16:18:07] <lxnay>	just because i go out walking
[sab lug 25 2009] [18:01:44] <lxnay|tw0>	ping
[sab lug 25 2009] [18:03:29] <lxnay|tw0>	just got back home, ping me back when available
[sab lug 25 2009] [18:35:45] <Betelgeuse>	I am havnig dinner first
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:32:38] <Betelgeuse>	I am around now
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:52:52] <lxnay|tw0>	here I am
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:53:21] <Betelgeuse>	How are you around tomorrow?
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:53:44] <Betelgeuse>	for planning the overall schedule
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:53:56] <lxnay|tw0>	well, i have a bbq but i should be avail in the afternoon
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:54:14] <lxnay|tw0>	it's very probable i'll be home tomorrow afternoon*
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:54:19] <Betelgeuse>	I am golfing between 9UTC and 15UTC
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:54:50] <lxnay|tw0>	mmh, that's the time delta i'll be out for sure
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:56:41] <Betelgeuse>	any way I am not planning reviewing more than one quiz today so we need to schedule when to continue
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:56:52] <Betelgeuse>	so are you around after 15UTC?
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:57:41] <lxnay>	that's very very probable, almost 100%
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:57:51] <Betelgeuse>	Ok suggest a concrete time then.
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:58:49] <lxnay>	let's make 15UTC
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:59:36] <lxnay>	problem is, i'm almost full time outside during weekends while I'm always on the PC (for work reasons) during the week
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:59:48] <Betelgeuse>	We can continue during the week too
[sab lug 25 2009] [19:59:52] <Betelgeuse>	I am around most evenings.
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:00:16] <lxnay>	me too, i work from home but still, i wake up at 8am (6UTC) every day
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:00:17] <Betelgeuse>	For tomorrow let's make it 16UTC if that's better in case the round is slow.
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:00:31] <Betelgeuse>	s/if/as/
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:00:59] <Betelgeuse>	or we can do it during the week, which one do you prefer?
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:01:23] <lxnay>	during the week I'm more reliable on timings
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:01:59] <lxnay>	it's up to you, if you're not overloaded during the upcoming week, it would be better
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:04:20] <Betelgeuse>	Just a tip: Best to answer my questions directly.
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:04:29] <Betelgeuse>	If I want to know which one is better, I want to know just that.
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:05:09] <Betelgeuse>	I don't have anything for Monday. When during the evening do you want to start?
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:05:21] <lxnay>	let's make the 2nd round during the upcoming week
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:05:59] <lxnay>	20UTC?
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:06:12] <Betelgeuse>	Can you make it earlier? I am +3 UTC
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:06:19] <lxnay>	17UTC?
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:06:27] <lxnay>	or even 15 if you like
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:06:32] <Betelgeuse>	17 UTC is fine
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:07:03] <lxnay>	ok then, Monday 26, 17UTC
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:07:23] <Betelgeuse>	ok for the review:
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:07:27] <Betelgeuse>	I will go through your answers, find out errors and ask some extras related and unrelated to the quiz questions. Take your time, it's supposed to be a learning experience as much as a test of your skills. But just tell me if you can't absolute find something so that you don't use too much time.
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:07:32] <Betelgeuse>	After the sessions you are asked to submit a fixed versions of the quizzes so logging the session might be prudent. 
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:07:52] <lxnay>	ok
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:08:02] <lxnay>	can ssuominen, my mentor, listen ?
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:08:07] <lxnay>	he asked me about that
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:08:08] <Betelgeuse>	if you want to
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:08:12] <lxnay>	ok
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:08:31] <Betelgeuse>	We talked on IRC. He had his mentor there but there's no need by policy.
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:08:42] <Betelgeuse>	So do you want him listening?
[sab lug 25 2009] [20:08:45] <lxnay>	sure

[sab set 19 2009] [19:59:42] <Betelgeuse>	I will try to read through the stuff today and will send you an email if there's something so it's in shape before the session.
[sab set 19 2009] [20:00:00] <Betelgeuse>	then the session can be shorter
[sab set 19 2009] [20:00:24] <lxnay>	ok thanks a lot
[sab set 19 2009] [20:01:46] <lxnay>	have a nice evening there, going out for a walk before getting laid ;) ehe. ttyt
[sab set 19 2009] [20:02:15] <Betelgeuse>	bye
[dom set 20 2009] [18:43:48] <lxnay>	perhaps there :) ?
[dom set 20 2009] [19:21:15] <Betelgeuse>	I just came home.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:25:06] <lxnay>	i am here if you have time
[dom set 20 2009] [19:27:39] <Betelgeuse>	Ebuild quiz: gentoo-core is not really a Gentoo Foundation ML as Foundation members don't need to be developers
[dom set 20 2009] [19:28:19] <Betelgeuse>	<25.07.2009 18:10> <@Betelgeuse> 1. Security does not belong to gentoo-core. Where does it belong to?
[dom set 20 2009] [19:30:03] <lxnay>	gentoo-security and bugzilla
[dom set 20 2009] [19:30:11] <Betelgeuse>	I mean you didn't fix that 
[dom set 20 2009] [19:30:21] <Betelgeuse>	There's still a note: (security?)
[dom set 20 2009] [19:30:32] <lxnay>	wait, let me check what I sent you
[dom set 20 2009] [19:30:44] <lxnay>	i have several versions around, gah
[dom set 20 2009] [19:32:16] <Betelgeuse>	I recommend git
[dom set 20 2009] [19:32:54] <lxnay>	eheh, i know ;) but I thought we were done with the quizzes and did not put under RCS
[dom set 20 2009] [19:33:52] <Betelgeuse>	<25.07.2009 18:07> <Betelgeuse> After the sessions you are asked to submit a fixed versions of the quizzes so logging the session might be prudent.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:33:59] <Betelgeuse>	:D
[dom set 20 2009] [19:34:22] <lxnay>	yeah yeah, i am a moron, i have the fixed one somewhere eheh
[dom set 20 2009] [19:34:40] <Betelgeuse>	We could probably recommend using a VCS to people.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:35:30] <lxnay>	i tell you, i use git for everything but this time, i didn't make a brain "connection" between the two things
[dom set 20 2009] [19:36:03] <Betelgeuse>	In the long run having people submit stuff to a web site would be useful.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:36:08] <Betelgeuse>	But would need to build that first.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:37:35] <lxnay>	sounds like something interesting to do ;)
[dom set 20 2009] [19:38:05] <lxnay>	anyway, i probably have the latest version on laptop, which is at my gf's house... so i am quickly reviewing all the answers, should be very quick
[dom set 20 2009] [19:38:37] <Betelgeuse>	It's hard to succeed that way.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:39:46] <Betelgeuse>	We can just try again tomorrow.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:39:53] <lxnay>	it's only ebuild-quiz
[dom set 20 2009] [19:40:31] <Betelgeuse>	BTW there's a new question to ebuild quiz.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:41:32] <Betelgeuse>	It's useful for ebuild maintenance so please throw in that one too.
[dom set 20 2009] [19:42:08] <Betelgeuse>	6.	What steps are needed to remove a use flag from IUSE in an ebuild?
[dom set 20 2009] [19:43:45] <lxnay>	ok ebuild-quiz is fixed
[dom set 20 2009] [19:43:54] <lxnay>	let me check for new questions i did not answer
[dom set 20 2009] [19:44:02] <lxnay>	gimme a sec
[dom set 20 2009] [19:48:30] <lxnay>	syncing ebuild-quiz ;) 2 new questions i need to copycat from logs
[dom set 20 2009] [19:55:09] <lxnay>	ok done
[dom set 20 2009] [19:55:13] <lxnay>	quick checking end-quiz
[dom set 20 2009] [19:59:14] <lxnay>	ok done
[dom set 20 2009] [19:59:16] <lxnay>	re-sending
[dom set 20 2009] [19:59:23] <lxnay>	and crossing fingers ;)
[dom set 20 2009] [20:02:09] <lxnay>	sent
[dom set 20 2009] [20:02:48] <lxnay>	if (attachment_issue) kill_myself_and_firegpg_and_spawn_thunderbird
[dom set 20 2009] [20:04:01] <lxnay>	doing pre-caching, already preparing mail with thunderbird ;)
[dom set 20 2009] [20:08:02] <Betelgeuse>	don't see it in inbox yet
[dom set 20 2009] [20:12:45] <lxnay>	still?
[dom set 20 2009] [20:14:11] <Betelgeuse>	yep
[dom set 20 2009] [20:16:46] <lxnay>	i sent it twice also
[dom set 20 2009] [20:17:10] <lxnay>	sounds weird
[dom set 20 2009] [20:20:57] <lxnay>	is there any other mail i could try then? i sent the 3rd
[dom set 20 2009] [20:21:24] <Betelgeuse>	It doesn't get archived then.
[dom set 20 2009] [20:25:09] <Betelgeuse>	it's probably temporary
[dom set 20 2009] [20:28:06] <lxnay>	i could try via IPoAC
[dom set 20 2009] [20:28:16] <lxnay>	maybe it can get there ;)
[dom set 20 2009] [20:28:26] <Betelgeuse>	well I have already spend enough time today :)
